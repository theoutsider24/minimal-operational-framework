# Documentation

## Internal

The purpose of internal documentation should be to provide a single authoritative set of facts about the system

The best way to achieve this is to keep the docs as close to the system implementation as possible

```Confluence``` has been a tool of choice in many organisations however this information can very quicky
become stale as well as being difficult to find

Documentation-as-code has the advantage that it can both be generated from the source code and kept close to
the source which makes it easier to spot drift and review documentation changes
